                <p>Apart from looking into which subject gains major or insufficient support, it is equally important to understand where all the research money come from and how much responsibility each institution undertakes in providing these funding. Due to different political environment and economic structures associated with each institution, the funding structure of every university is interestingly different.</p>

                <p>Johns Hopkins University relies 86 percent of its research activities on federal grants, compared to the San Francisco and Los Angeles campuses of University of California and UW-Madison, where only half of research funding is from federal source. It's advantage in federal funding is even more salient when looking at the actual dollar amount.</p>

                <p>Only exceeded by University of Michigan, UW-Madison receives the second most state funding in dollar amount, which accounts for 35 percent of its overall research cost. </p>

                <p>Duke University has a major support from surrounding businesses, something desirable but difficult to achieve for UW-Madison, according to Natasha Kassulke, Strategic Communication Manager for the Vice Chancellor for Research Office. </p>

                <h2>Graduate research impacted by collaboration with undergrads</h2> 

                <p>Undergraduate research participation at UW-Madison has consistently provided students with learning opportunities not available to them within the classroom. Undergraduate students involved in various fields of research have reported a plethora of benefits that their lab participation has brought them, but they are not the only ones who benefit from undergraduate research. </p>

                <p>As a graduate student conducting research on non-linear vibrations, Robert Lacayo believes that his research benefits from collaboration with undergrads. </p>

                <p>“If there are more people working on something, obviously things will move along more quickly,” said Lacayo. “Also, with these students working on certain parts of the research, I’m able to focus more on different specific aspects, which increases the quality of the work being done.” </p>

                <p>As facilitators of research labs, professors and graduate students work directly with their undergraduate assistants to gather and analyze information to further discovery. Though they have more experience in their field, facilitator’s work can be enhanced by collaboration with undergraduates. </p>

                <p>“As a graduate student who entered school with clear intentions of doing research for an advisor, it’s very rewarding to work with undergrads who are where I was three years ago,” said Lacayo. “I don’t only teach these students; I learn from them as well because they are curious and have new ideas.”</p>

                <p>Graduate students facilitating research are responsible for not only propelling student research participation, but mentoring students as well. This guidance has the potential to benefit the field of research through encouraging further involvement. </p>

                <p>“Encouraging people’s knowledge about a subject can be overwhelming for them sometimes, especially if this is their first research position,” said Lacayo. “But being able to mentor students and help them become interested in engineering as a future benefits the research in this field because there will be more top-notch scholars in the field when they are done with school.”</p>

                <p>While the undergraduate research experience benefits undergraduates in a variety of ways, the graduate research experience has benefits too. And by combining the two, mutual growth and understanding become possible.  </p>

                <h3>UW-Madison Serves Up a Buffet of Varied Research </h3>

                <p>UW-Madison does a lot of research. So much, in fact, it’s hard to keep up with it all. To help you stay abreast — and sound smart at the next cocktail party — here’s a few of the school’s recent standout projects: </p>

                <ul class="talking-points">
                    <li>Providing a better understanding of the Zika virus and finding ways to stop it from spreading</li>
                    <li>Researching children’s emotional development and the relationship between early emotional experience and child psychopathology</li>
                    <li>Examining how disparities in socioeconomic status affect children’s development, and how these effects may be altered by policies and programs, especially early childhood education programs</li>
                    <li>Creating innovative energy harvesting and storage technology by using human motion, such as walking to power mobile electronic devices</li>
                    <li>Discovery of a new fish virus that is a key suspect in a die-off of largemouth bass. This discovery could help protect a critical natural resource and the quality of life in Wisconsin</li>
                    <li>Researching infant music perception, and the relationship between music and language learning</li>
                    <li>Investigations into influenza, including changing how flu vaccines are made by providing faster and more cost-effective methods, that could help us beat back the type of flu viruses that have erupted into deadly pandemics in the past</li>
                    <li>Creating an atlas of 23,000 plant and bacterial proteins to ultimately help inform a strategy for engineering the nitrogen-fixing ability of legumes into other plants, thus answering a challenge in agricultural biotechnology</li>
                    <li>Improving the understanding of the nature and rate of cognitive decline among patients with Alzheimer’s disease, and improved ability to track and anticipate the progression of Alzheimer’s that will help in the development and evaluation of preventative drugs.</li>
                    <li>Strengthening our satellite imagery technology, including inventing the instrumentation to make possible the animated satellite pictures that are staples of TV weather reports</li>
                </ul>
