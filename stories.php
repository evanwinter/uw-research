					<p>In light of the decreased support for UW-Madison from the state budget, faculty members have been experiencing and reacting to this trend.</p>

					<p>It’s been about a year since faculty members from several UW institutions declared no confidence in the system’s leader Ray Cross over the change of the faculty tenure policy. Moreover, faculties are constantly approached and recruited by other institutions. Each year more than one in five faculty members who received outside offers eventually left Wisconsin, usually taking their research grants with them, creating losses in both financial and intellectual capacity of the state’s flagship university.</p>

					<p>Recently, the consequence is made visible by the latest research university ranking by National Science Foundation: UW-Madison unprecedentedly slided out of top five in terms of research and development expenditures.</p>

					<p>The National Science Foundation is an independent federal agency funding federal researches in non-medical areas. It produces rankings of U.S. universities’ research capacity based on yearly census data on over 900 institutions.</p>

					<p>This particular ranking looks at how much money from federal government, state, private businesses and nonprofits is spent on research and development activities across different universities in the 2015 fiscal year. NSF also produces other rankings that focus on research universities’ federal research obligations, number of doctorates granted and number of full-time graduate student enrollment.</p>

					<p>With 115 research centers and programs, UW-Madison is long known nationwide or even worldwide for its research capacity, especially in areas of education, communication and sociology, according to US News & World Report rankings.</p>

					<p><h2>Decipher the numbers</h2></p>

					<p>According to NSF Higher Education Research Development survey data, throughout the years, UW-Madison has been holding a stable position among the Big Ten institutions in terms of research expenditures - usually right after University of Michigan in most of the subjects.</p>

					<p>Nonetheless, among all universities in the country, more public institutions were ahead of UW than last year, pushing it out of the array of top five in terms of total research and development expenditure.</p>

					<p>For science and engineering research expenditure, UW-Madison has experienced a steady decline from top two or three before 2010 all the way to the 12th in 2015. Its disadvantages are even more salient in federally sponsored science and engineering programs expenditure. It has never come back up in top 10 since 2010.</p>

					<p>Within the historical trend of UW-Madison’s ranking, biological science, medical science stand out as the two subjects that spend increasingly less money on research. Physical science and psychology display the similar trend, but both subjects achieves major growth in the latest fiscal year.</p>

					<p><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/ningyuan-asf-3.png"></p>

					<p><span class="caption">Most subjects experience growths and cuts in research funding, but expenditures for biological science and medical science are constantly achieving negative growth. | Source: National Science Foundation, Higher Education Research and Development Survey | Graph by: Ningyuan Ma</span></p>

					<p>Noticeably, since the cost of research could vary greatly across subjects, and different universities have their unique structures of research programs development, the numeric order of ranking itself could only provide limited and even misleading information.</p>

					<p>Among the top 10 research universities in 2015, University of California, San Francisco seems to be a special case. It has an unparalleled capacity in medical research, spending on it over a million, or 5 percent of expenditures of all the institutions. Producing nothing in other research areas except 50 grands on physical science, UCSF is able to win the reputation of No. 4 research university purely by its achievement in medicine and public health. And that could be a rather peculiar case for a research university.</p>

					<p>If each institution is scored by a 10-point scale on its expenditure ranking on each subject: 10 points for every 1st place, one point for every 10th place, UW-Madison, Johns Hopkins University and University of Michigan would occupy the first three places.</p>

					<p><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/ningyuan-asf-1.png"></p>
					<span class="caption">The nature of imbalance of research development and expenditures across subjects requires a deeper look into what different numbers in rankings actually mean. | Source: National Science Foundation, Higher Education Research and Development Survey | Graph by: Ningyuan Ma</span> 

					<p>On the other hand, UW-Madison has a stable and outstanding performance in the research on subjects other than science and engineering. The flagship university in Wisconsin consistently spends the most money among the Big Ten, midwest and the entire country researching subjects like education, humanities, communication, law and business, exceeding the first runner-up, New York University by more than 30 million dollars.</p>

					<h2>Making Research Work</h2>

					<p>Vice Chancellor for Research Marsha Mailick wrote in her blog “Making Research Work” about strategies to address this result, which she believed was “disappointing but not altogether a surprise.” </p>

					<p>“There are at least five factors that, when combined, created a perfect storm for the decline,” Mailick wrote. “These reasons include salaries for faculty and staff that remain stagnant, a declining faculty hiring rate, changing faculty demographics, a shrinking principal investigator pool, and increased faculty responsibilities that take time away from research.”</p>

					<p>The average age of faculty members and the percentage of those aged 65 and above are slightly increasing overtime, according to an Academic Planning and Institutional Research report in 2015. This aging tendency of the faculty team, as well as the separation of tenured professors attracted by other institutions, partly accounts for the shrinking pool of senior researcher who are able to get funding and direct influential research, according to Natasha Kassulke, Manager of Strategic Communications for the Vice Chancellor for Research.</p>

					<p>“It’s great to have young, fresh minds, and their energy and creativity, but they don’t yet have the experience,” Kassulke said.</p>

					<p>The university implements new initiatives to increase interconnectivity between faculties from different disciplines, and to help faculties realize their innovative ideas.</p>

					<p>To innovate the recruitment process, the university is going to resume the “cluster hiring” method first implemented in 1998 to attract faculties from different fields a multidisciplinary project. It fosters collaborative education, research and outreach, breaking down the boundaries of individual department.</p>

					<p>Another initiative further focuses on inspiring faculties to create a potentially groundbreaking project with the help of multidisciplinary resources and infrastructures across campus. Funded by Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, UW2020 entails an average of $300,000 award to support high-risk, high impact research proposals in any subject. It acts as a preparation stage for researchers to envision, with the ultimate goal that their projects are competitive enough to gain more funding.</p>

					<p>“These (projects) are meant to be multidisciplinary. They are innovative, novel, new ideas, sort of like the researcher’s dream project,” Kassulke said.</p>

					<p>In order to retain competent faculty members when the support from state government cannot be expected, the university will manage to establish connections with the public and private business for potential financial support, according to Kassulke.</p>

					<p>“We don’t wanna be good. We wanna be great. We wanna be a destination for the best and the brightest. And to do that we’ve got a lot of work to do,” Kassulke said. “It’s a very very competitive environment, but I think that’s what helps fuel innovation.”</p>

					<h1> Despite falling rankings, students report benefits of undergraduate research </h1>

						The undergraduate experience is determined by a variety of opportunities that are unique to every student and every institution. Regardless of rankings and funding, research serves not only as a supplement to learning, but as an experience that molds the futures of participating students.

					<!-- <img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/research-1.jpg"> -->

					<p>When Ashley LeBeouf began looking at colleges during her junior year of high school, the University of Wisconsin-Madison quickly became her primary choice. Knowing that she wanted to pursue a degree in both psychology and sociology, she was able to look further into the opportunities the university could provide her. Four years later as a junior at UW, LeBeouf was offered a research assistant position studying the psychology of intergroup relations, and knew she had chosen the right university. </p> 

					<p>In 2010, the Association of American Colleges and Universities published a peer review discussing the impact that undergraduate research has on the student experience. The AACU conducted a survey gathering information about the experiences that undergraduates had while conducting research, and concluded that these opportunities enhance the college experience by supplementing classroom learning, directing career choices and providing life skills.</p> 

					<p>UW-Madison’s ability to conduct and release high volumes of research has led the school to be recognized as one of the top research universities in the nation for decades.</p>

					<p>However, near the end of 2016, the National Science Foundation released new rankings of research universities in the U.S., with UW-Madison dropping out of the top five for the first time since 1972. The rankings reflect the amount of research spending as well as the volume of research that each university conducts. Robert Lacayo, who researches non-linear vibrations, does not believe these rankings to carry significant weight.</p> 

					<p>“The only real contribution I see in the rankings is just publicity,” said Lacayo. “Some of these rankings are based on total funding and expenditure, yet say nothing about the quality of work being done. They’re just too broadsweeping to answer any real questions about how these schools do research so I put hardly any stock in them.”</p>

					<p>Besides believing the rankings to be unreliable and opinionated, Katie Kudrna, who researches pathogenic carrier mosquitoes, believes that while rankings may be a sign of a quality university, the content of the research being done is more important.</p> 

					<p>“The research we conduct in our lab is very valuable because there are many diseases worldwide that are spread by mosquitoes,” said Kudrna. “Because many of these diseases are fatal, our work has the potential to save many lives in the near future.”</p> 

					<p>Regardless of rankings or volume of research, Kudrna believes it’s still important for schools to be proud of the research they are conducting.</p> 

					<p>“Much of the work being done at any given university is important in furthering our knowledge of the planet and the beings that reside on it,” she said. “I believe that universities should still share their accomplishments so that the public can be aware of the work being done.”</p>

					<p>Though research is not funded by the state, recent state budget cuts may pose a threat to the research done at UW.</p> 

					<p>Because faculty are paid by the state, cuts in funding may influence faculty to leave the university and go elsewhere. As other states increase university funding, it could become attractive for top faculty to continue research at a university that pays them more for their work.</p> 

					<p>This potential loss of research faculty could also make it more difficult for students to conduct quality research in their field. Because of that, the nation’s top students may also be swayed from attending UW.</p> 

					<p>“Since I plan on pursuing graduate studies funded by research, these cuts could affect my ability to be funded for graduate school,” said Aaron Huxford, a junior researching nuclear materials. “Along with that, if research faculty in my field are affected by the cuts, I may not even be able to research what I want. I never thought I’d leave UW post-undergrad but I have been looking into other options.”</p>

					<p>Despite this, research conducted at UW-Madison has been globally recognized for well over 100 years, and new discoveries are continually made by those participating in labs. While faculty and graduate students are the backbone of most research, student-led research is common as undergraduates design and direct their own projects.</p> 

					<p>Within her research on intergroup relations, LeBeouf observes the reactions that white individuals have in regards to racial biases and incidents, which has led her to become curious about future research opportunities.</p> 

					<p>“I’d really like to do my own research at some point,” said LeBeouf. “I came here to do that, and by the time I’m done as an undergrad I think I’ll know the direction that I want to take my own research. But as of now the lab I’m in has really taught me a lot about how to research and tailor my thought process to that sort of thing.”</p>

					<p>While research opportunities do pull prospective students to UW-Madison, there are some student researchers who were either not aware of the research options they had, or were not planning on doing research at all.</p> 

					<p>“When I was a freshman, I thought it was intimidating to think about doing research and school at the same time,” said Huxford. “However, I’ve learned to better balance my schedule and use my time more efficiently.”</p>

					<p>Unlike Huxford, Lacayo never envisioned himself becoming involved in research.</p> 

					<p>“As someone who transferred to UW-Madison during my undergrad, I certainly did not see myself doing research today,” he said. “I know for some of the student researchers the idea of coming to Madison and doing research are one and the same, but I just kind of fell into it.”</p>

					<p>Though many research labs are a major time commitment for students, credit is often given for being a part of a lab. Along with gaining credit and experience, many students who conduct or assist with research reported in the AACU survey that the experience benefits them outside of the lab as well.</p> 

					<p>“You learn so much cool stuff about the field you’re in, but then outside of that you also learn how to better analyze and understand research papers, and it can also lead you to a career that you maybe hadn’t thought of before,” said Huxford. “I feel like I have done way better in classes since starting research because you just learn to think differently.”</p>

					<p>Along with enhanced academic performance, student researchers gain skills that will remain applicable throughout the duration of their schooling and beyond.</p> 

					<p>“Working in teams is really a life skill and being in a research lab forces you to do that,” said LeBeouf. “You literally depend on these people, you build this trust in them because you need to in order to achieve your goal of discovering new things. That’s a skill that research has given me.”</p>

					<p>Looking at the ways in which people’s minds work in various subconscious ways led LeBeouf to begin work at Mendota Mental Health, speaking with and profiling various patients, something she hopes to do after graduation.</p> 

					<p>“I don’t know if I would have even applied at Mendota if I hadn’t started doing this research. It made me realize that I’m really interested in how people process information that they aren’t actually thinking about,” she said. “I knew that I wanted to go into forensic psychology, but because of my lab and this job, I know now that that really is possible.”</p>

					<p>The undergraduate experience is determined by a variety of opportunities that are unique to every student and every institution. Participating in research as an undergraduate benefits each student in different ways, but generally undergraduate researchers come out of their lab with skills that they did not previously have. Regardless of rankings and funding, research serves not only as a supplement to learning, but as an experience that molds the futures of participating students.</p>

					<p>When news broke last November that UW-Madison was no longer ranked as one of the nation’s top five research universities, you’d swear the sky had fallen and landed right on Bucky Badger’s head.</p>

					<p>Everyone from retired researchers to tech start-up CEOs bemoaned the slip from fourth to sixth place in the National Science Foundation rankings, which determines a school’s standing against others by how much money they spend on research. </p>

					<p>While some sounded a mild alert that the school needed to make some quick, corrective efforts to not slip further, others felt that the university was in a death spiral and that nothing less than drastic changes would save it.</p>

					<p>It turns out, the cause for the drop was a decline in research spending of more than $100 million between 2012 and 2015. Specifically, the state’s flagship university spent $1.17 billion on research in 2012 but spent only about $1.07 billion in 2015. The last time UW-Madison ranked outside of the survey’s top five research research institutions was 1972.</p>

					<p>With the questions of what and how answered, UW administrators quickly turned to blame the why of the situation on lawmakers. “The numbers show that our faculty and staff are highly successful, although continued disinvestment by the state is having an impact on our ability to compete,” said Marsha Mailick, UW-Madison’s vice chancellor for research and graduate education, in a statement. Her premise was the decline in state support — via funding — is leading to an exodus of talented professor/researchers who took their large research grants with them when they left for jobs elsewhere. </p>

					<p>The Republican-led legislature shrugged off the ranking slip news and disregarded blame for the drop. Gov. Scott Walker’s office released a statement noting that UW-Madison remains one of the best-funded universities in the nation and an increase in funding was coming but that it would likely be tied to performance-based metrics.</p>

					<p>After the dust settled a bit, Mailick echoed her earlier complaint, turning it into more of a plea for funding to the UW Board of Regents in early February. More money will result in more faculty and then faculty will have more time to write grant proposals, conduct research and train students in research, she said, adding that the increase in funds could also be used to update laboratories with new technology. Currently, the university is waiting to see what kind of increase in funding they may receive in the next biennial state budget (Gov. Walker has proposed a modest bump). </p>

					<p>But in the meantime, a couple of questions remain: first, do these rankings and others like them even matter? And if so, to whom? As expected, the replies differ greatly depending on who you ask.</p>

					<h3>UW Reacts</h3>

					<p>Not surprisingly, the answer from the university’s communications camp — the school’s loudest cheerleaders — is a mixed ‘Yes, the rankings matter, but not too much … we’re still great.’</p>

					<p>As far as the ranking unit used, money is a great measuring stick, says Käri Knutson of University Communications. “Research funding is essential to the work that we do in keeping pace with the nation’s elite research institutions,” she explained, quickly adding that these rankings aren’t the only way to measure success.</p>

					<p>“Rankings are a tool to help us measure ourselves and see areas that might need improvement. However, they are by no means the only or most important measure of a university’s success,” she continues. “Rankings are something we pay attention to, but our larger mission is as it has always been to ensure that our students are getting the top-notch education people.”</p>

					<p>Others, however, are much more sour on the notion that college rankings matter at all regardless who does the ranking, the NSF or some magazine.</p>

					<p>“They’re a marketing ploy,” wrote New York Times education columnist Frank Bruni in a column last September. “The rankings nourish the myth that the richest, most selective colleges have some corner on superior education; don’t adequately recognize public institutions that prioritize access and affordability; and do insufficient justice to the particular virtues of individual campuses.”</p>

					<p>“[These] rankings are front and center, fostering the idea that schools are brands in competition with one another,” continued Bruni, who was unavailable for comment but did author the NYT best-seller “Where You Go Is Not Who You'll Be,” an examination of the college admissions frenzy. “Intentionally or not, [the rankings] fuel a frenzy to get into the most selective schools. They can’t adjust for how well certain colleges serve certain ambitions.”</p>

					<h3>Researchers React</h3>

					<p>When I reached out to those being ranked by the NSF — the researchers themselves — none of them wanted to talk on the record. (Given their relevance and proximity to the problem — alleged problem? — I decided including them using a limited description was sufficient.) </p>

					<p>Some of them were concerned.</p>

					<p>“The rankings are a trailing indicator — things like this don’t really bob up and down,” said one researcher in the chemistry department. “[The decrease in state support and funding] is a sign that academic life here isn’t good [and] we’ve lost faculty and failed to gain other faculty because of that. There are downstream effects to this.”</p>

					<p>He adds: “Do I care about the rankings? No, but I care about the reason we’ve gone down in them.”</p>

					<p>Other researchers, however, were more flippant.</p>

					<p>“Our NSF ranking isn’t something I think about in the lab — I’m more concerned with our team’s NCAA ranking,” quipped one scientist who does research in an animal-testing laboratory.  “That said, I’m not surprised we’re headed down given the current legislature. The reputation that we’re not supporting our faculty is getting around.”</p>

					<h3>The Turnaround</h3>

					<p>Another animal researcher says the dip in the NSF ranking isn’t too much to worry about at this point and that it was “very predictable.”</p>

					<p>“Over the years, we had seen that we were on a predictable path toward a decline in funding from groups like the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes for Health,” says that professor, adding that he and his colleagues have long discussed the rankings. “As we’re slipping, others are skyrocketing.”</p>

					<p>The dip in funding is noticeable and significant. “It affects everything we do,” he continued. “We’ll have less grad students now because we can’t fund them and they’ll go elsewhere and we’ll have fewer undergrads working in the labs. It all leads to less research.”</p>

					<p>This professor says there were a number of reasons for our funding slip, but points to the top of the chain as the source. “The leadership structure was the problem — the previous [UW-Madison] administration,” he said, noting that the top officials at the university assumed things would continue to carry on as they always had, unabated and unassisted. </p>

					<p>Since the drop in the NSF ranking, however, UW-Madison has made some moves to address the problem beyond just asking the state legislature for more funding. </p>

					<p>“First off, the folks in Washington D.C. didn’t know who we were anymore, they’d forgotten about the UW. That’s important because that’s where the funders are — that’s where the NSF is, that’s where the NIH is,” said the researcher. “So, we opened an office there to make sure they see us, to make sure they hear us and know about our work and grant applications.”</p>

					<p>“We’ve also restructured our research mission. With these changes and keeping an eye on it, I think we’ll be able to regain our lost momentum,” he continued. “Just like that these things take time to see there’s a problem, they take time to see improvement. I’m confident that within five years or so, we’ll be back up there.”</p>

					<h1> Non-STEM research and the difference between cost and value </h1>
					<p class="excerpt"> Science and engineering research gets far more funding than non-STEM research, largely due to costs. But how does that affect how we value these different types research? </p>

					<p>UW-Madison has long been known as a top-tier research institution. Year after year it landed in the National Science Foundation’s top five for research and development expenditures, until this past fall when it fell to the sixth spot after a reduction in spending. While it’s unclear whether this is an anomaly or the start of a pattern, the drop in rankings has been enough to cause unrest among many in the university’s community.</p>

					<p>At nearly every research university in the nation, funding for humanities, education, communication and business research pales in comparison to that which goes toward fields associated with science and engineering. Among the nation’s top 10 research universities in R&D expenditures, spending in non-STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) fields was around 5 percent in 2015. </p>

					<p>According to UW’s 2015-2016 data digest, STEM fields received nearly $500 million from national federal organizations between 2013 and 2014 for research and development, while non-STEM fields received about $26 million.</p>

					<p>This deficit can be explained mostly by the very nature and costs of STEM research; the equipment and facilities required for much science and engineering research is often extremely expensive, and in some specific areas of research like medical research, materials are used up during the process. These factors, in addition to an enormously high demand for such research and the fact that private donors and funding organizations have agency over which domains they spend their money in, contribute to the massive amounts of money being spent on STEM research compared to non-STEM research. </p>

					<p>Emily Clark, Associate Director of the UW-Madison Center for the Humanities and researcher whose work focused on contemporary literature, said that she worries that this deficit in funding – while it may often be reasonably explained by costs of the research – has negative connotations about the value of the less costly and therefore less funded areas of research. </p>

					<p>“Money is seen as associated with value. So with groups that are getting big grants and big portions of money, the public is thinking, ‘That must be a valuable thing––that’s why they’re getting so much money,’” she said. “And often, that’s true. But that is not – and cannot be seen as – the only indicator of value.”</p>

					<p>Clark explained that even within the Humanities department, the projects that have received substantially more funding have also received much more attention––despite the actual research being of similar value and quality.</p>

					<p>“We’ve gotten a number of million-dollar-plus grants from the Mellon Foundation for Humanities research, which is not the norm,” she said. “When we get those grants, we get far, far more attention from media outlets, other institutions, etcetera, than we do for research that’s of comparable value and quality but without the high dollar sign attached.”</p>

					<p>Matthew Hora, UW assistant professor of liberal arts and applied studies, said that while non-STEM is funded far less, the two are equally important for students’ ability to perform in their careers, regardless of field. </p>

					<p>“Even for success in really specific fields like STEM, students need to have proficiency and competency for long term success,” he said. “And they get these largely from liberal arts and humanities.”</p>

					<p>In 2015, UW-Madison’s research and development spending was split about 88 percent to 12 percent in favor of STEM research domains, according to the National Science Foundation. This is over twice the national average for non-STEM spending, and just under twice the average for other Big Ten universities.</p>

					<p>Despite UW-Madison’s relatively high spending on non-STEM fields, recent changes with the university’s funding structure could be perceived as prioritizing certain programs over others at the expense of the proliferation of quality liberal arts education.</p>

					<p>Gov. Scott Walker recently introduced a plan to implement performance-based funding at UW System schools, essentially tying future funding to metrics such as the percentage of students who receive degrees in high-demand fields or find jobs in fields related to their degrees. </p>

					<p>Some higher educational policy experts worry that this will disproportionately encourage universities to push students toward STEM paths at the expense of liberal arts enrollment. </p>

					<p>Bob Mathieu, the director of the Wisconsin Center for Education Research – which falls under the non-STEM category – said that he’s more concerned about the total funding availability than its relative portioning. </p>

					<p>However, he also said that he believes many non-STEM programs are ultimately undervalued, citing concerns similar to Clark’s worry that amount of funding is conflated with value.</p>

					<p>“I would like to see an enhancement in funding of education research, of the social condition, of arts and humanities … All of these advance the human endeavor and the human spirit, and I think [they] are undervalued when measured by the investment of societal resources.”</p>

					<p>While there’s much variation within the broad category, experts say that non-STEM fields often face challenges that many in the science and engineering research fields do not. </p>

					<p>One such challenge that exists is what Clark describes as the commodification of research––and more specifically, the difficulty Humanities researchers have in doing so.</p>

					<p>“If you can think of research as creating a product that is sellable, then that is easily understood as valuable,” she said. “Humanities research is very, very rarely able to do that. I think that leads a sense of there being less value, because there’s not money attached to the research.”</p>

					<p>Drawing on the example of research on human rights activism, Clark said that although this is very timely and relevant information for students, faculty and activists to understand, “it’s not equated to something we can sell; it’s not something that will make people money.” </p>

					<p>Clark also recognized that not all STEM research is marketable as a product or commodity, but noted that such projects are usually not the ones receiving the enormous amounts of funding and attention that we so often associate with the STEM fields.</p>

					<p>In addition to the commodification of research, non-STEM researchers face still other challenges. Mathieu said that education researchers in particular face challenges in trying to isolate the different parts of their research due to the highly interactive and social nature of education.</p>

					<p>“Education is an extraordinarily complex social phenomenon that interacts in complex ways with the social, political and cultural contexts in which it occurs,” he explained. “Many science and engineering experiments can be conducted in highly controlled laboratory settings and variables. These conditions do not occur in education research, a field in which even controlled experiments have to be implemented in complex social contexts.”</p>

					<p>Education Leadership and Policy Analysis Chair Eric Camburn said that while there are fundamental differences between the way STEM and non-STEM fields perform research and gain insight from it, the methods employed are not always so different. </p>

					<p>“Some research in education bears a similarity to science and engineering research, particularly engineering research,” Camburn said. “Investigators design a new educational practice, they randomly assign people to implement the practice or not, and they study the effect of the implementation of the practice on some outcome.”</p>

					<p>Mathieu noted that there were indeed differences in the challenges faced by researchers within the two categories, but he ultimately took a similar position to Camburn with regard to the universality of those differences.</p>

					<p>“On the cutting edge of the unknown, the similarities of natural and social sciences are greater than you might think,” he said.</p>

					<p>Mathieu went on to explain that there is an ever-growing component of education research that blurs the line between science and non-science. He cited specific examples from within Wisconsin’s own research community such as educational psychology research on statistical models, and studies connecting neuroscience with learning.</p>

					<p>Each year, the National Science Foundation (NSF) releases a series of research rankings based on the total research and development expenditures of higher learning institutions across the country. Year to year there are fluctuations in the order of the top schools, but two have held firm: John Hopkins University and the University of Michigan.</p>


					<p>John Hopkins is the nation’s top research institution, and has campuses and affiliates across the East Coast of the United States. The University of Michigan—which is ranked second nationally —maintains the majority of its research within the university’s grounds in Ann Arbor, Michigan, a very different practice than its Baltimore based competitor.</p>

					<p>In 2015, the National Science Foundation reported that the University of Michigan had just under $1.37 billion of research expenditures. This earned the Big Ten school the title of being the United States’s top-ranked public research institution—again. </p>

					<p>And with the University of Wisconsin slipping to sixth in total research and development expenditures for the first time since 1972, the Ann Arbor-based institution is now the only university from the Midwest to remain in the top five. </p>

					<img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/jack-graph.png">

					<p>The importance of these rankings, though, is something that varies greatly depending on the institution that you are at, according to David Lampe, the Executive Director for Strategic Communications with the University of Michigan’s Office of Research. He stated that the details behind the rankings are what is important, more than the number itself. </p>

					<p>“[The rankings are] not a matter of constant concern,” Lampe said. “For the most part, people don't tend to think about them all the much. What matters to [graduate students and faculty] is the details—the volume of research in their specialty.”</p>

					<p>The University of Michigan administrator went on to explain that the rankings published by the NSF are a widely accepted standard among universities, and that they do not serve much of a purpose beyond this. Lampe stated that the rankings are useful for “comparing apples to apples,” but that there are numerous other ways that the University of Michigan, and other schools, measure the excellence of their research. </p>

					<p>“For us it's just one of many measures of any university,” he said. “The volume of research expenditures is useful, but there are many many other measures. There are many ways to measure our performance, our excellence, our reputation.” </p>

					<p>Other benchmarks the University of Michigan uses to measure its success include: the impact of scholarships, number of collaborations with professional organizations and other institutions, media coverage and the role that faculty members have on “decision making in Washington,” according to Lampe. He also suggested that most faculty members “may not even remember” where the university is ranked. </p>

					<p>However, Cordelia Ziraldo, a researcher that was formerly with the University of Michigan’s Linderman Research Group, would disagree with Lampe’s sentiment that these rankings do not matter. </p>

					<p>The Michigan native, who originally arrived at her home state’s flagship university to work as a postdoctoral researcher, explained that researchers at the individual lab level are still “pinching pennies” and trying “to stretch grant money as far as it will go.” Ziraldo stated that this makes the NSF’s rankings important, because the University of Michigan could be more likely to get research grants than smaller institutions based on reputation.</p>

					<p>Beyond funding, she suggested that the University of Michigan also attracts researchers and students that are at a different level than other schools in the country.</p>

					<p>“In terms of quality of people that you interact with, I definitely noticed a difference,” Ziraldo said. “The people who are willing to go to Michigan—it's just more competitive. I don't know how else to say it. It's more competitive. [The university does] attract a higher caliber of both faculty, as well as students.”  </p>

					<p>She also cited reasons that these rankings are important at a personal level. The name recognition of the university is something that was important to Ziraldo, because “it's a lot easier for someone scanning a resume to recognize the importance of the University of Michigan, than it is for them to read the title of your work and the description.” </p>

					<p>“I did want a school that was well regarded in terms of the rigor of its research program, because I knew that no matter what I did next, whether it was in academia or not, having a big-name school on my C.V. would carry a lot more weight than a smaller one,” she said. </p>

					<p>This theme of personal importance is something that was echoed by David Vargas, a 2017 graduate of the University of Michigan. However, he had a very different journey to Ann Arbor than Ziraldo. </p>

					<p>Born in Denver, Vargas and his family returned to his parents’ hometown of Medellin, Colombia when he was 3 months old. The Michigan alumnus lived in Colombia until he was 18-years-old, when he and his parents returned to the United States so Vargas could go to school.</p>

					<p>They moved to North Carolina, where Vargas originally attended the University of North Carolina-Greensboro. After an unhappy first semester, though, the Colombian-American decided to leave the university. </p>

					<p>"While I was [at the university], I totally hated it,” he explained. “I was like, 'no this is boring, I don't like this.’”</p>

					<p>With plans to return to Colombia, Vargas had a change of heart while on vacation with his family in the Bahamas. While on the trip he met a girl who attended the University of Michigan, “and a little love story started to develop.” After spending the better part of the trip together, Vargas was convinced that he should give Michigan a try. </p>

					<p>“I had my flight back to Colombia, and she was like, 'yeah, but you can come here and study, get your degree, etcetera,’” he said. “I decided that I was going to apply for my FAFSA, and I got it, and I decided to stay.” </p>

					<p>For the first two years Vargas was in Ann Arbor, he attended Washtenaw Community College, completing general graduation requirements during his time as a member of the Wolfpack. And after the completion of his fourth semester, he transferred to the University of Michigan. </p>

					<p>In his first year as a Wolverine, Vargas was admitted to the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program, and worked in a chemistry lab that focused on developing new biocatalysts for organic reactions. </p>

					<p>“It was very specific. The faculty that I worked for is an organic chemist, and is pretty well known for doing model systems for enzymes,” he said. “I wasn't just cleaning beakers and wiping things off. I was doing real research.”</p>

					<p>Vargas also explained that the research experience at the University of Michigan is what shaped what he wanted to do, and helped him to be able to gain admission to the University of Rochester, where he will begin graduate school in the fall. </p>

					<p>“Now that I am finished, I do realize how important it was for me [to do research], and how, at least in my case, it affected the places that I was able to get into for grad school,” Vargas said. “The name [of the university] definitely helped.” </p>

					<p>With his future career still unknown, there is one that that Vargas knows for sure he wants to be involved in: research. </p>

					<p>The University of Michigan is still waiting to receive its ranking for the 2016 fiscal year, according to Lampe. The administrator explained that a report containing the university’s total research and development expenditures was filed with the NSF in January, and that the rankings will be released in November. </p>

					<p>However, with initiatives in green energy, self-driving cars and a new 32-acre research facility on campus, Lampe remains confident that the University of Michigan will continue its “excellence in research.”</p>
