				<h2>Non-STEM Research</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="post-body hide">

				UW-Madison has long been known as a top-tier research institution. Year after year it landed in the National Science Foundation’s top five for research and development expenditures, until this past fall when it fell to the sixth spot after a reduction in spending. While it’s unclear whether this is just an anomaly or if it’s the start of a pattern, the drop in rankings has been enough to cause unrest among many in the university’s community.

				<p>At nearly every research university in the nation, funding for non-STEM fields – like humanities, education, communication and business – pales in comparison to that which goes toward fields associated with science and engineering. Among the nation’s top ten research universities in R&D expenditures, spending in non-STEM fields was around 5 percent in 2015.</p>

				<p>According to UW’s 2015-2016 data digest, STEM fields received nearly $500 million from national federal organizations between 2013 and 2014 for research and development, while non-STEM fields received about $26 million.</p>

				<p>This deficit can be explained mostly by the very nature and costs of STEM research; the equipment and facilities required for much science and engineering research is often extremely expensive, and in some specific areas of research like medical research, consumables are key to the process. These factors, in addition to an enormously high demand for such research, lead to massive amounts of money being spent on STEM research compared to non-STEM research.</p>

				<p>Another factor to consider is that private donors and funding organizations have agency over the research domains to which they donate their money.</p>

				<p>Matthew Hora, UW assistant professor of liberal arts and applied studies, said that while non-STEM is funded far less, the two are equally important for students’ ability to perform in their careers, regardless of field.</p>

				<p>“Even for success in really specific fields like STEM, students need to have proficiency and competency for long term success,” he said. “And they get these largely from liberal arts and humanities.”</p>

				<p>In 2015, UW-Madison’s research and development spending was split about 88 percent to 12 percent in favor of STEM research domains. This is over twice the national average for non-STEM spending, and just under twice the average for other Big Ten universities. Out of these schools only Rutgers, which on the whole spends a small fraction of that which UW-Madison spends on research, has a higher percentage of non-STEM research spending.</p>

				<p>Despite UW-Madison’s relatively high spending on non-STEM fields, recent changes with the university’s funding structure could be perceived as prioritizing certain programs over others at the expense of the proliferation of quality liberal arts education.</p>

				<p>Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker recently introduced a plan to implement performance-based funding at UW System schools – essentially tying future funding to metrics such as the percentage of students who receive degrees in high-demand fields or find jobs in fields related to their degrees.</p>

				<p>Some higher educational policy experts worry that this will disproportionately encourage universities to push students toward STEM paths at the expense of liberal arts enrollment.</p>

				<p>Bob Mathieu, the director of the Wisconsin Center for Education Research – which falls under the non-STEM category – said that he’s more concerned about the total funding availability than its relative portioning.</p>

				<p>However, he also said that he believes many non-STEM programs are undervalued, due to a phenomenon by which funding drives people’s perception of a field’s importance.</p>

				<p>“I would like to see an enhancement in funding of education research, of the social condition, of arts and humanities … All of these advance the human endeavor and the human spirit, and I think [they] are undervalued when measured by the investment of societal resources.”</p>

				<p>While there’s much variation within the category, experts say that non-STEM fields often face challenges that many in the science and engineering research fields do not.</p>

				<p>Mathieu said that education researchers deal with a number of challenges that researchers in STEM fields either do not have to face, or have the ability to work around.</p>

				<p>“Education is an extraordinarily complex social phenomenon that interacts in complex ways with the social, political and cultural contexts in which it occurs,” Mathieu said. “Many science and engineering experiments can be conducted in highly controlled laboratory settings and variables. These conditions do not occur in education research, a field in which even controlled experiments have to be implemented in complex social contexts.”</p>

				<p>Education Leadership and Policy Analysis Chair Eric Camburn said that while there are significant epistemological differences between STEM and non-STEM fields, the research that occurs within each is often not so different.</p>

				<p>“Some research in education bears a similarity to science and engineering research, particularly engineering research,” Camburn said. “Investigators design a new educational practice, they randomly assign people to implement the practice or not, and they study the effect of the implementation of the practice on some outcome.”</p>

				<p>Though Mathieu noted the differences in the challenges faced by researchers within the two categories, he ultimately took a similar position.</p>

				<p>“On the cutting edge of the unknown, the similarities of natural and social sciences are greater than you might think,” he said.</p>

				<p>He also explained that there is an ever-growing component of education research that blurs the line between science and non-science.</p>

				<p>“David Kaplan in Ed Psych does fundamental research on mathematic statistical methods. Another group of new faculty are connecting neuroscience with learning.”</p>
